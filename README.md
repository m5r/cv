This is the repo where I keep my CV.
You can find both  the [english version](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/m5r/cv/master/english/cv.pdf) and the [french one](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/m5r/cv/master/fran√ßais/cv.pdf).

It is based on [AwesomeCV](https://github.com/posquit0/Awesome-CV) which is written in [LaTeX](http://www.latex-project.org/).
